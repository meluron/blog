# Installing Package Manager

The first thing I do is install a package manager tool called `Homebrew` using which I can install all other useful softwares.

To install `Homebrew`, simply open the terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
