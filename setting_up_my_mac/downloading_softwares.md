# Downloading Softwares

There are some common softwares that I install using `homebrew`.

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>tree</strong></td>
      <td>A recursive directory listing program that produces a depth-indented list of files (like a tree diagram).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>zig</strong></td>
      <td>A general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal, and reusable software.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>uv</strong></td>
      <td>A fast Python package installer and resolver, intended as a drop-in replacement for <code>pip</code> and <code>pip-tools</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>visual studio code</strong></td>
      <td>A code editor developed by Microsoft.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>git</strong></td>
      <td>A version control command-line tool. Installing this should also install Xcode command-line utilities.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

To install these softwares, you can run:

```zsh
brew install tree
brew install zig
brew install uv

brew install --cask visual-studio-code
brew install git
```

> [!TIP]
Avoid downloading softwares from websites if they are available at `Homebrew`. 

To uninstall any software downloaded using `homebrew`, you can simply run
```zsh
brew uninstall [name]
```
